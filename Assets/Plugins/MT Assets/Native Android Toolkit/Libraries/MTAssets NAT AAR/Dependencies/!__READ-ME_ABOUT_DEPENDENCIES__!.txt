- Any dependencies added in "Dependencies" folder must also be in the
  file "Dependencies.asset" present in "Libraries/MTAssets NAT AAR".

- If any dependency of "Dependencies" folder is updated, it must also have
  its meta data updated in the file "Dependencies.asset".

- If any dependence on "Dependencies" folder is removed or updated to a new
  version, the old AAR file to be removed, must be deleted from "Dependencies"
  folder and registered as obsolete in "Dependencies.asset".

- After completing the editing of the file "Dependencies.asset", click
  in "Update XML for Play Services Resolver". Thus, if the user will
  install "Play Services Resolver" on their project, "Play Services
  Resolver" will find this XML and know that NAT needs these dependencies.
  This can be useful if the user comes to install any tools that include
  automatically "Play Services Resolver" in the future, such as Unity ADS,
  Unity Mediation SDK, Google Play Games SDK, Firebase SDK etc.

- Do not manually modify the file "PlayServicesResolverDependencies.xml"
  found inside the "Editor" folder. It is managed by the
  "Dependencies.asset" file and can only be updating using the button
  "Update XML for Play Services Resolver" for this.

- The name of the dependence files present in "Dependencies" folder should
  follow the current standard of "<group>-<package>-<version>.aar", that is,
  they must be the same are in the Maven Repository, for example
  "com.google.android.gms-play-services-location-18.0.0.aar" as this way
  the file "Dependencies.asset" can correctly inform the dependencies in
  the XML file for the "Play Services Resolver" tool.
