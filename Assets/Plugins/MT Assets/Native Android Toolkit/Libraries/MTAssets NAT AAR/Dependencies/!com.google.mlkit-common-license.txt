Terms of Service

Use of ML Kit is subject to the Google APIs Terms of Service. (https://developers.google.com/terms)

Privacy

When you use ML Kit APIs, processing of the input data (e.g. images, video, text) fully happens on-device,
and ML Kit does not send that data to Google servers. As a result, you can use our APIs for processing
data that should not leave the device.

The ML Kit APIs may contact Google servers from time to time in order to receive things like bug fixes,
updated models and hardware accelerator compatibility information. The ML Kit APIs also send metrics about
the performance and utilization of the APIs in your app to Google. Google uses this metrics data to measure
performance, debug, maintain and improve the APIs, and detect misuse or abuse, as further described in
our Privacy Policy (https://policies.google.com/privacy).

You are responsible for informing users of your app about Google’s processing of ML Kit metrics data as
required by applicable law.

Data we collect includes the following:

All APIs

- Device information (such as manufacturer, model, OS version and build) and available ML hardware accelerators
  (GPU and DSP). Used for diagnostics and usage analytics.
- App information (package name / bundle id, app version). Used for diagnostics and usage analytics.
- API configuration (such as image format and resolution). Used for diagnostics and usage analytics.
- Event type (such as initialize, download model, update, run, detection). Used for diagnostics and usage analytics.
- Error codes. Used for diagnostics.
- Performance metrics. Used for diagnostics.
- Per-installation identifiers that do not uniquely identify a user or physical device. Used for operation of remote
  configuration and usage analytics.
- Network request sender IP addresses. Used for remote configuration diagnostics. Collected IP addresses are retained
  temporarily.

Digital Ink Recognition, Entity Extraction, Text Recognition

- Configured languages. Used for diagnostics and usage analytics.

Image Labeling, Object Detection and Tracking

- This data is collected only when the API is used with custom models:
  Name, version, and URI/URL of the machine learning model for diagnostics
- When using Firebase Model Deployment (https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml/manage-hosted-models) to remotely host a
  custom model, refer to the FirebaseMLModelDownloader (https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/app-store-data-collection#firebasemlmodeldownloader)
  section in Prepare for Apple's App Store data disclosure requirements (https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/app-store-data-collection).

Language ID, Smart Reply

- 	Identified languages. Used for diagnostics and usage analytics.

Translate

- Configured source and destination languages. Used for diagnostics and usage analytics.
